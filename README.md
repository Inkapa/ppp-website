# PPP Interview website

Responsive interview website built with Bootstrap as a first semester project during my first year of undergrad. We had to
interview a professional in the field of IT Security and make a 3 minute video about it for the
2020 parcoursmétier competition in France. We were voted as the best video in our school, but unfortunately never heard
back from our teacher for the national competition to which the best project was supposed to be submitted.

# Preview
The website is available in both French and English
